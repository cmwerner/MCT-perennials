# MCT-perennials

## Code used in manuscript, running on computer cluster
mct-partitions-functions.R includes all the functions used for the simulations and analyses
mct-partitions-run.R is the wrapper code for executing the code on the computer cluster
MCT-perennials_partitioning-figures.Rmd is the figure plotting code using the data generated by the simulation runs

## Code for peer analysis
MCT-perennials_partitioning-code.Rmd is a simplified version of the code used in this manuscript which can be easily run on an individual computer. It uses the data provided in the model-parameters files.
